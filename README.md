## Step 1: Play the game [here](https://www.benmanley.biz/memory-game-plus/) to become familiar with it.  
# 
## Step 2: Write the user stories.  User stories are a great way to define what the application should accomplish.  They also serve as a framework for writing out more thorough pseudocode.
- AAU, I should see a list of difficulty options upon the page loading.
- AAU, I should see a different number of cards on the screen depending on the difficulty selected.
- AAU, I should see a reset button that appears only after selecting a difficulty.
- AAU, I should see messages prompting me to select a difficulty, choose a card, informing that the cards don't match, informing that a match has been found.
- AAU, when I click the first card, it's value should be displayed.
- AAU, when I click the second card, it's value should be displayed, along with a message depending on whether or not the cards match.  If the cards match, they should remain flipped.  If they don't match, they should flip back after a short delay.
- AAU, upon finding all the matches, I should see a congratulatory message with the total number of matches and the time it took to find them all.
- AAU, the game should restart when I push the 'reset' button. 
# 
## Step 3: Write out the pseudocode.  Be sure to be as detailed as possible.  The more detailed your pseudocode, the less jumping around you'll have to do when writing the code for the application.
- Define a constant to hold difficulty settings.
- Define variables for the cards in play, the value of the first card drawn, the value of the second card drawn, the index of the first card drawn, the index of the second card drawn, the turn (1 and -1), seconds for a time counter, total time to find all the matches, and a Boolean for determining whether to pause for a delay after clicking the second card. (phew...)
- Define cached element references for a div holding the reset button (to hide it), a div holding the difficulty buttons, the message display element, the play area, and the reset button.
- Define event listeners for the div holding the reset button, the div holding the difficulty buttons, and the play area.  
- Configure the event listeners to rotate between displaying the difficulty buttons and the reset button.
- Write a function to handle setting the difficulty of the game based on the button pressed.  The event handler should pass a number to this function indicating the number of cards to add to the cards in play.
- Using the number of cards passed to the difficulty function, generate a random set of cards to be shuffled.  These cards should then be passed to a shuffle function.
- Write the shuffle function.  It should take in an array of card values, shuffle them, and add each value to an object that also holds an identifier for determining how to display the cards in the render function.  0 will denote a card that is face down, 1 denotes a face up card that is being evaluated as a match, and 2 denotes a card that has been matched and remains face up. The array of cards should be stored in a variable for cards in play, which would look as follows, before and after the shuffle function:
```
['d05', 'hK', 's07', 'cA']   -->    [{0:'d05'}, {0:'hK'}, {0:'s07'}, {0:'cA'}]
```
- Write a render function that displays cards by appending them as children div elements to the play area.  (Hint:  Initializing the play area inner html will remove all cards immediately before a render is called.  This prevents the cards from piling up out of control.)  Stub up conditional statements for rendering cards based on their identifier (0, 1, or 2) in the object.  
- Write the conditional statements for each of the 3 card options.  Add a class name to the div based on the CSS selectors defined in cardstarter.css.  If the card is a 0, it should be face down.  If the card is a 1 or 2, it should be face up, value showing.  Append the divs to the play area.
- Write an initialization function that resets the play area.  Include all necessary variables to reset, including the full deck of cards, which will have been mutated in the previous game.  Call the initialization function at the top of the function section in main.js.
- Call a function in the play area click event listener to handle picking a card.  Be sure to pass the event to the function.
- Define the function to handle picking a card.  Store the index of the card clicked in a variable to access within conditional statements.  Hint:
```js
let cardClickedIdx = Array.from(evt.target.parentNode.children).indexOf(evt.target);
```
- The handle pick function should only be evaluating cards denoted with 0 in their objects (1 and 2 are already face up, and shouldn't need ot be clicked.)  Set up a conditional statement that screens for only 0 values (if 1 or 2, nothing happens).  Within this conditional statement, write two additional conditional statements, one for handling a first card pick and one for a second card pick.  (turn = 1 or -1)  Assign the value and the index of each card to variables for both the first and second cards.  All 4 of these variables should be passed as arguments to a function to compare the cards.
- Write the function to compare cards.  Pass in as arguments the values and indicies of both cards for comparison.  Write conditional statements for handling whether the cards are the same or not.  If they are, change their denotation from a 1 to a 2.  If they don't match, change both to 0.  Display messages in the message cached element informing the user of a match or a miss.
- Add a conditional statement to check whether all of the matches have been found.  Add an incrementor for the match count variable here, and where applicable above for init purposes.  If so, congratulate the winner using the message cached element.
- Write a setInterval function to handle counting the number of seconds since the game started.  Write a clearInterval function to stop the timer before restarting it for a new game.  Put the timer functions in the appropriate locations to get it rolling.
- Add logic to the compare cards function's win condition that evaluates the time elapsed at the moment the matches are complete.  This should then be displayed, along with the count of total matches to the message element.
- Add a setTimeout function to the handle pick function's conditional statement for the second card pick.  Build in a delay to execute before rendering the cards to give the user an opportunity to see the card they picked incorrectly before it disappears.


# 
## Step 4: Take a look at the starter code.  The main.js file contains an array of cards to serve as a full deck to draw from.  The HTML and CSS have been provided and the script tag for the JS is already included in the HTML file.  The basic scaffolding for each section of the application have been defined.  The CDN link for Bootstrap has been included.  
# 
## Step 5: Images/CSS for playing card designs have been included and cardstarter.css has included in the HTML file.  In order to assign a playing card image to an HTML element, all you have to do is add the card name as a class.
## The following code would be used to display a face up card (King of Diamonds) and a face down card with a red back:
```html
<div class="card large dK"></div>
<div class="card large back-red"></div>
```
## Step 6: Define a constant to hold difficulty settings:
```js
/*------Constants------*/

const difficulty = {
    "Easy": 5,
    "Medium": 10,
    "Hard": 15
}
```
# 
## Step 7: Define variables for the cards in play, the value of the first card drawn, the value of the second card drawn, the index of the first card drawn, the index of the second card drawn, the turn (1 and -1), seconds for a time counter, total time to find all the matches, and a Boolean for determining whether to pause for a delay after clicking the second card. (phew...):
```js
/*------Variables------*/

let winTime, seconds, matchCount, card1Val, card1Idx, card2Val, card2Idx, waitingForTimeout;
let cardsInPlay = [];
let turn = 1;
let deck = ["dA","dQ","dK","dJ","d10","d09","d08","d07","d06","d05","d04","d03","d02","hA","hQ","hK","hJ","h10","h09","h08","h07","h06","h05","h04","h03","h02","cA","cQ","cK","cJ","c10","c09","c08","c07","c06","c05","c04","c03","c02","sA","sQ","sK","sJ","s10","s09","s08","s07","s06","s05","s04","s03","s02"];
```
# 
## Step 8: Define cached element references for a div holding the reset button (to hide it), a div holding the difficulty buttons, the message display element, the play area, and the reset button:
```js
/*------Cached Element References------*/

const resetDiv = document.getElementById('resetDiv');
const buttonDiv = document.getElementById('difficultyButtons');
const messageEl = document.getElementById('message');
const playArea = document.getElementById('playArea');
const resetBtn = document.getElementById('resetButton');

```
# 
## Step 9: Define event listeners for the div holding the reset button, the div holding the difficulty buttons, and the play area:
```js
/*------Event Listeners------*/

playArea.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
})

resetBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
})

buttonDiv.addEventListener('click', function() {
})
```
# 
## Step 10: Configure the event listeners to rotate between displaying the difficulty buttons and the reset button:
```js
resetBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
    buttonDiv.setAttribute("class", "");
    resetDiv.setAttribute("class", "hidden");
})

buttonDiv.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
    // Add the conditional statement to make sure a button is clicked, not empty space
    if (evt.target.innerText) {
        buttonDiv.setAttribute("class", "hidden");
        resetDiv.setAttribute("class", "");
    }
})
```
# 
## Step 11: Write a function to handle setting the difficulty of the game based on the button pressed.  The event handler should pass a number to this function indicating the number of cards to add to the cards in play:
```js
// Update the event handler
buttonDiv.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
    if (evt.target.innerText) {
        buttonDiv.setAttribute("class", "hidden");
        resetDiv.setAttribute("class", "");
        // Uses the difficulty object to pass a number of cards to the setDifficulty function
        setDifficulty(difficulty[evt.target.innerText]);
    }
})
.
.
.
function setDifficulty (noCards) {
}
```
# 
## Step 12: Using the number of cards passed to the difficulty function, generate a random set of cards to be shuffled.  These cards should then be passed to a shuffle function:
```js
function setDifficulty (noCards) {
    let cardsToShuffle = [];
    let cardToAdd;
    for (let i = 1; i <= noCards; i++) {
        // For each card in difficulty, remove a card from the full deck and add it to an array of cards to be shuffled
        cardToAdd = deck.splice(Math.random() * deck.length + 1, 1);
        // Adds TWO of each card to the cards to be shuffled
        cardsToShuffle.push(cardToAdd.toString());
        cardsToShuffle.push(cardToAdd.toString());
    }
    shuffle(cardsToShuffle);
}
```
# 
## Step 13: Write the shuffle function.  It should take in an array of card values, shuffle them, and add each value to an object that also holds an identifier for determining how to display the cards in the render function.  0 will denote a card that is face down, 1 denotes a face up card that is being evaluated as a match, and 2 denotes a card that has been matched and remains face up. The array of cards should be stored in a variable for cards in play, which would look as follows, before and after the shuffle function:
```
['d05', 'hK', 's07', 'cA']   -->    [{0:'d05'}, {0:'hK'}, {0:'s07'}, {0:'cA'}]
```
```js
function shuffle(cardsIn) {
    let cardsToShuffle;
    // For every card in the deck to be shuffled, take one out of the array and add it to the array of cards to be used in the game
    for (let i = 0; i = cardsIn.length; i++) {
        cardsToShuffle = cardsIn.splice(Math.random()*cardsIn.length, 1)
        cardsInPlay.push({0: `${cardsToShuffle.toString()}`});
    }
    // Call the render function to display the cards on the screen
    render();
    // Log the cardsInPlay array to the screen for debugging while building the game
    console.log(cardsInPlay);
}
```
# 
## Step 14: Write a render function that displays cards by appending them as children div elements to the play area.  (Hint:  Initializing the play area inner html will remove all cards immediately before a render is called.  This prevents the cards from piling up out of control.)  Stub up conditional statements for rendering cards based on their identifier (0, 1, or 2) in the object:
```js
function render() {
    playArea.innerHTML = '';
    cardsInPlay.forEach(function(card) {
        // If the card's object is a 0, it is face down, waiting to be picked
        if (card[0]) {
            // Create a div element
            // Add a class name to the div to render the back of a card
            // Append the div to playArea
        // If the card's object is a 1, it is face up, being evalutated as a match
        } else if (card[1]) {
            // Create a div element
            // Add a class name to the div to render the value of the card, face up
            // Append the div to playArea
        // If the card's object is a 2, it is face up, confirmed as a match
        } else if (card[2]) {
            // Create a div element
            // Add a class name to the div to render the value of the card, face up
            // Append the div to playArea
        }
    })
}
```
# 
## Step 15: Write the conditional statements for each of the 3 card options.  Add a class name to the div based on the CSS selectors defined in cardstarter.css.  If the card is a 0, it should be face down.  If the card is a 1 or 2, it should be face up, value showing.  Append the divs to the play area:
```js

function render() {
    playArea.innerHTML = '';
    cardsInPlay.forEach(function(card) {
        if (card[0]) {
            let appendCard = document.createElement("div");
            appendCard.className = "card large back-red";
            playArea.appendChild(appendCard);
        } else if (card[1]) {
            let appendCard = document.createElement("div");
            appendCard.className = `card large ${card[1]}`;
            playArea.appendChild(appendCard);
        } else if (card[2]) {
            let appendCard = document.createElement("div");
            appendCard.className = `card large ${card[2]}`;
            playArea.appendChild(appendCard);
        }
    })
}
```
# Step 16: Write an initialization function that resets the play area.  Include all necessary variables to reset, including the full deck of cards, which will have been mutated in the previous game.  Call the initialization function at the top of the function section in main.js:
```js
/*------Functions------*/

init();

function init() {
    // Clears the message element and resets to display difficulty message
    messageEl.innerText = 'Please select a difficulty:';
    matchCount = 0;
    turn = 1;
    // Clears all the card div elements in the playArea
    playArea.innerHTML = '';
    cardsInPlay = [];
    // Initializes the deck back to being a full set of 52 cards
    deck = ["dA","dQ","dK","dJ","d10","d09","d08","d07","d06","d05","d04","d03","d02","hA","hQ","hK","hJ","h10","h09","h08","h07","h06","h05","h04","h03","h02","cA","cQ","cK","cJ","c10","c09","c08","c07","c06","c05","c04","c03","c02","sA","sQ","sK","sJ","s10","s09","s08","s07","s06","s05","s04","s03","s02"];
    render();
}
```
# 
## Step 17: Call a function in the play area click event listener to handle picking a card.  Be sure to pass the event to the function:
```js
playArea.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
    handlePick(evt);
})
```
# 
## Step 18: Define the function to handle picking a card.  Store the index of the card clicked in a variable to access within conditional statements.  Hint:
```js
let cardClickedIdx = Array.from(evt.target.parentNode.children).indexOf(evt.target);
```
# 
## Step 19: The handle pick function should only be evaluating cards denoted with 0 in their objects (1 and 2 are already face up, and shouldn't need ot be clicked.)  Set up a conditional statement that screens for only 0 values (if 1 or 2, nothing happens).  Within this conditional statement, write two additional conditional statements, one for handling a first card pick and one for a second card pick.  (turn = 1 or -1)  Assign the value and the index of each card to variables for both the first and second cards.  All 4 of these variables should be passed as arguments to a function to compare the cards:
```js
function handlePick(evt) {
    // Assigns the index of the card being clicked to a variable
    let cardClickedIdx = Array.from(evt.target.parentNode.children).indexOf(evt.target);
    // Checks to make sure the card clicked is face down
    if (cardsInPlay[cardClickedIdx][0]){
        // Conditions for the first card click
        if (turn === 1) {
            card1Val = cardsInPlay[cardClickedIdx][0];
            card1Idx = cardClickedIdx;
            cardsInPlay[cardClickedIdx] = {1: card1Val};
        // Conditions for the second card click
        } else if (turn === -1) {
            card2Val = cardsInPlay[cardClickedIdx][0];
            card2Idx = cardClickedIdx;
            cardsInPlay[cardClickedIdx] = {1: card2Val};
            compareCards(card1Idx, card1Val, card2Idx, card2Val);
            render();
        }
        turn *= -1;
        render();
    }
}
```
# 
## Step 20: Write the function to compare cards.  Pass in as arguments the values and indicies of both cards for comparison.  Write conditional statements for handling whether the cards are the same or not.  If they are, change their denotation from a 1 to a 2.  If they don't match, change both to 0.  Display messages in the message cached element informing the user of a match or a miss:
```js
function compareCards(card1Idx, card1Val, card2Idx, card2Val) {
    if (card1Val === card2Val) {
        matchCount++;
        messageEl.innerText = 'You found a match!';
        // Assigns the card as face up, and a match
        cardsInPlay[card1Idx] = {2: card1Val};
        cardsInPlay[card2Idx] = {2: card2Val};
    } else {
        messageEl.innerText = 'Nope, try again!';
        // Assigns the card as face down
        cardsInPlay[card1Idx] = {0: card1Val};
        cardsInPlay[card2Idx] = {0: card2Val};
    }
}
```
# 
## Step 21: Add a conditional statement to check whether all of the matches have been found.  Add an incrementor for the match count variable here, and where applicable above for init purposes.  If so, congratulate the winner using the message cached element:
```js
function compareCards(card1Idx, card1Val, card2Idx, card2Val) {
    if (card1Val === card2Val) {
        matchCount++;
        messageEl.innerText = 'You found a match!';
        cardsInPlay[card1Idx] = {2: card1Val};
        cardsInPlay[card2Idx] = {2: card2Val};
    } else {
        messageEl.innerText = 'Nope, try again!';
        cardsInPlay[card1Idx] = {0: card1Val};
        cardsInPlay[card2Idx] = {0: card2Val};
    }
    if (matchCount === cardsInPlay.length / 2) {
        messageEl.innerText = `You found ${matchCount} matches!`;
    }
}
```
# 
## Step 22: Write a setTimeout function in the handlePick function to add a delay for flipping the cards back over when a user does not find a match.  Put a check for the Boolean in the line where checking for the card's object.  Initialize the Boolean in the init function:
```js
function init() {
    seconds = 0;
    messageEl.innerText = 'Please select a difficulty:';
    matchCount = 0;
    turn = 1;
    // Add this line
    waitingForTimeout = true;
.
.
.


function handlePick(evt) {
    let cardClickedIdx = Array.from(evt.target.parentNode.children).indexOf(evt.target);
    // Don't forget to add the check for waitingForTimeout here
    if (cardsInPlay[cardClickedIdx][0] && waitingForTimeout){
        if (turn === 1) {
            card1Val = cardsInPlay[cardClickedIdx][0];
            card1Idx = cardClickedIdx;
            cardsInPlay[cardClickedIdx] = {1: card1Val};
        } else if (turn === -1) {
            card2Val = cardsInPlay[cardClickedIdx][0];
            card2Idx = cardClickedIdx;
            cardsInPlay[cardClickedIdx] = {1: card2Val};
            // Add this function for a 1 second delay
            setTimeout(function() {
                compareCards(card1Idx, card1Val, card2Idx, card2Val)
                render();
                waitingForTimeout = true;
            }, 1000)
        }
        turn *= -1;
        render();
    }
}
```
# 
## Step 23: Write a setInterval function to handle counting the number of seconds since the game started.  Write a clearInterval function to stop the timer before restarting it for a new game.  Put the timer functions in the appropriate locations to get it rolling:
```js
setInterval(addSecond, 1000);

function addSecond() {
    seconds++;
}
```
```js 
// Don't forget to add a reset for the timer in the init function
function init() {
    seconds = 0;
    messageEl.innerText = 'Please select a difficulty:';
.
.
.
```
# 
## Step 24: Add logic to the compare cards function's win condition that evaluates the time elapsed at the moment the matches are complete.  This should then be displayed, along with the count of total matches to the message element:
```js
function compareCards(card1Idx, card1Val, card2Idx, card2Val) {
    if (card1Val === card2Val) {
        matchCount++;
        messageEl.innerText = 'You found a match!';
        cardsInPlay[card1Idx] = {2: card1Val};
        cardsInPlay[card2Idx] = {2: card2Val};
    } else {
        messageEl.innerText = 'Nope, try again!';
        cardsInPlay[card1Idx] = {0: card1Val};
        cardsInPlay[card2Idx] = {0: card2Val};
    }
    // New code is in this conditional
    if (matchCount === cardsInPlay.length / 2) {
        winTime = seconds;
        let min, sec;
        min = Math.floor(winTime / 60);
        sec = winTime % 60;
        messageEl.innerText = `You found ${matchCount} matches in ${min}:${sec}!`;
    }
}
```
# ----------  Code Checkpoint -----------
